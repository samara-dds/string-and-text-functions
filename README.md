## üöÄ Vowel Count

### üìã Description:

Write a function in Python called count_vowels that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels present in that string. Consider that the vowels are 'a', 'e', ‚Äã‚Äã'i', 'o' and 'u' (lowercase and uppercase).

First, define the count_vowels function that accepts a string as an input argument.

```
 def tell_vowels(string):

```

Initialize a variable to store the number of vowels found in the string. You can start with 0.

```
def tell_vowels(string):
    counter_vowels = 0
```

Use a loop to loop through each character in the input string.

```
def tell_vowels(string):
    counter_vowels = 0
    for caracter in string:
```

For each character in the string, check whether it is a vowel. You can do this by comparing the character with a list of vowels ('a', 'e', ‚Äã‚Äã'i', 'o', 'u') in lowercase and uppercase.

```
def tell_vowels(string):
    counter_vowels = 0
    for caracter in string:
        if caracter.lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
```

If the current character is a vowel, increment the vowel counter.

```
def tell_vowels(string):
    counter_vowels = 0
    for caracter in string:
        if caracter.lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
            counter_vowels += 1
```

After traversing the entire string, return the counter value, which represents the total number of vowels found in the string.

```
def tell_vowels(string):
    counter_vowels = 0
    for caracter in string:
        if caracter.lower() in ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']:
            counter_vowels += 1
    return counter_vowels

print(tell_vowels("Hello World")) # Exit: 3
```

## Invert a String

### Description:

Write a function in Python called invert_string that takes a string as input and returns that string inverted.

First, define the invert_string function that accepts a string as an input argument.

```
def reverse_string(string):

```

Initialize a variable to store the reversed string. You can start with an empty string.

```
 string_reverse= ""
```

Use a loop to cycle through each character in the input string, from last to first.

```
 for item in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
```

For each character in the input string, add it to the inverted string you are constructing.

```
string_reverse += string[item]
```

After traversing the entire string, return the inverted string you constructed.

```
return string_reverse
```

to finish:

```
string_original = "Hello World"
string_reverse= reverse_string(string_original)
print(string_reverse)  # Exit: "dlroW olleH"
```
